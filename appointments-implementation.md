# Online Medical Appointment Booking System - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a comprehensive online booking system for medical services, including doctor scheduling, patient booking interface, and availability management.

## Phase 1: Database Schema & Models

  - [ ] start_time (time)
  - [ ] end_time (time)
  - [ ] service_id (foreign key to services)
  - [ ] max_appointments (integer)
  - [ ] is_active (boolean)
  - [ ] created/modified timestamps

### 1.2 Create Schedule Exceptions Table
- [ ] Create migration for `schedule_exceptions` table:

  - [ ] date (date)
  - [ ] is_working (boolean - for extra working days)
  - [ ] start_time (nullable time)
  - [ ] end_time (nullable time)
  - [ ] reason (text)
  - [ ] created/modified timestamps

### 1.3 Update Appointments Table
- [ ] Add migration to add new fields:
  - [ ] appointment_time (time field, separate from date)

  - [ ] Step 3: Select date and available time slot
  - [ ] Step 4: Enter patient details
  - [ ] Step 5: Review and confirm

### 3.3 Availability Calculation Engine
- [ ] Create AvailabilityService component with methods:
  - [ ] getAvailableDoctors($specialty, $date)
  - [ ] getAvailableSlots($doctorId, $date, $serviceId)
  - [ ] isSlotAvailable($doctorId, $date, $time, $serviceId)
  - [ ] calculateEndTime($startTime, $serviceDuration)
  - [ ] checkConflicts($doctorId, $date, $startTime, $endTime)

### 3.4 Availability Rules Implementation
